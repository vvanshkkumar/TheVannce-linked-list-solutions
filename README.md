# Linked List Problems â€“ TheVannce

This repository contains code + whiteboard snapshots for all Linked List problems I solve on my YouTube channel [TheVannce](https://www.youtube.com/@theVannce).

Iâ€™m uploading each problem one by one â€” not in bulk â€” to focus on clean explanations, dry runs, and clarity. Each folder here includes:

- âœ… My custom C++ code
- ðŸ§  The whiteboard snapshot used during explanation
- ðŸŽ¥ Direct link to the video for full walkthrough

##  My Goal

I'm not just solving â€” I'm teaching the way I wish someone had taught me when I was stuck. Step-by-step dry runs, no skipping intuition, no shortcuts. Just actual understanding.
