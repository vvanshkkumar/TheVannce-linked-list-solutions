# Linked List Problems – TheVannce

This repository contains code + whiteboard snapshots for all Linked List problems I solve on my YouTube channel [TheVannce](https://www.youtube.com/@theVannce).

I’m uploading each problem one by one — not in bulk — to focus on clean explanations, dry runs, and clarity. Each folder here includes:

- My custom C++ code
- The blackboard snapshot used during explanation
- Direct link to the video for full walkthrough

## My Goal

I'm not just solving — I'm teaching the way I wish someone had taught me when I was stuck. Step-by-step dry runs, no skipping intuition, no shortcuts. Just actual understanding.
